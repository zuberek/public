- data and metadata in the same file

- hierarchy: folders -> tags -> links 
	- the more comoplex the thinking, more move to the right
	- folders are physical limiations for paper
	- use PARA tags to start with for simple staff, project, area, resource, archive
	- named links for strong relations in properties
	- regular links for soft relations

- use metadata as front matter
